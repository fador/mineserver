diff for next release always available @ http://www.alhem.net/Sockets/latest_diff.html

2.3.9.3
--------
Added multithread support in sockethandler. New method SetNumberOfThreads()
enables this.
New method in sockethandler: Release(). Make select() release before
specified timeout. Enable function with method EnableRelease().
EventHandler using new release functionality.
Thread startup controlled with semaphore instead of flag/sleep combo.
Default thread startup behaviour is run at once, optional is wait until
released by posting to semaphore (via method SetRelease(true)).
Adding a socket with closeanddelete flag set now works as expected.
Added platform independent method Utility::Sleep( milliseconds ).
Added missing win32 implementation in new sockethandler.
Added win32 implementation of Semaphore.
Repaired build for cygwin/mingw/devcpp.

2.3.9.2
--------
More internal restructuring of SocketHandler.
The Get() method has been removed. Set() has been split into three:
ISocketHandler_Add(), ISocketHandler_Mod(), and ISocketHandler_Del().
New methods defined in ISocketHandler interface to support different 
models of socket io: ISocketHandler_Select(), MaxCount().
Removed Set() method from Socket class.
Implemented SocketHandlerEp using epoll for linux only.
reinterpret_cast<> added in ListenSocket for ipv6 address struct.
HttpPostSocket member variable holding http headers (m_fields) is now
protected (changed from private).
Repaired Reconnect function in sockethandler.

2.3.9.1
--------
Using thread- and memory safe clib/c runtime function when possible.
Restructured sockethandler internals.
Quicker tcp shutdown sequence when sockets lib initiates close.
Renamed Utility::GetCurrentDirectory to Utility::CurrentDirectory, and
added Utility::GetEnv().
Removed unused triggers code.

2.3.9
------
TcpSocket using std::vector<char> to receive incoming line (OnLine
callback). Configurable max limit for library available in sockets-config.h,
default 8192 bytes (TCP_LINE_SIZE). Override ISocketHandler::MaxTcpLineSize
to change this value without recompiling the library.
Added more operators in Debug class. Removed some leftover debug printouts.
HttpResponse returns non-const output file.
HTTPSocket aborts after receiving more than 200 (MAX_HTTP_HEADER_COUNT) http
headers. Use method HTTPSocket::SetMaxHeaderCount() to modify this value.
Reordered log level enum, added minlevel to StdoutLog.

2.3.8
------
SSL sockets now operate in nonblocking mode. A much better solution to the
"hang" problem mentioned in 2.3.7.
Added Path() method to IFile interface. Returns File path name or MemFile
virtual path name.
Added constructor in MemFile that takes a File as input. Will read the
entire File to memory. Added constructor in MemFile that copies another
memfile. Will use the source memfile when reading.
Added reference count when a MemFile object is source for another memfile.

Set OnTransferLimit back to 0 after a successful transfer of requested file
(in Ajp13Socket and HttpBaseSocket). Reset IFile auto_ptr to
decrease the reference count asap (by using fclose).

2.3.7
------
Moved some #include's outside the sockets namespace definition.
Fix code to avoid an increment on an stl iterator that has reached end.
Helping compilers deal with it++ when result is not used, changed all it++
to ++it where appropriate.
Doing an extra select on write readiness on file descriptor before calling
SSL_write. Prevents a hang situation when the remote end drops the
connection.

2.3.6
------
Added improved Valid() method using unique socket instance identifier. Using
this identifier internally for events and resolver. Added optional data
parameter in Event class, used by library to store socket instance
identifier.
No longer using SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY for ssl connections. If remote end
disconnects this would cause hangups.
Using SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE because the library supports this.
Renamed EventHandler() method in IEventOwner to GetEventHandler().
Added file system path abstraction methods to Utility.
Reset file descriptor after successful close of a ListenSocket.

2.3.5
------
Added method(s) in UdpSocket to set default interface to be used for multicast.
Added flag for position independent code for linux-x86-32 architecture (see
Makefile.Defines.linux-x86-32).
Added missing includes (on some distributions/gcc versions).
SetUri in HttpRequest no longer URLDecodes the entire url.
Fix for static variables in SSLInitializer.
Fix for new version of openssl (const SSLxx_method()).
Fix for getnameinfo.
Modified Utility::Uri parser class so it also splits the url in path /
querystring parts.

2.3.4
------
Some .cpp were missing namespace declarations - fixed. Some includes for
ipv6 was missing - fixed. Operators in StreamWriter class modified to work
on 64-bit as well as 32-bit systems.

2.3.3
------
Fix deadlock in SSLInitializer introduced in 2.3.2.
Added check when select() returns -1 indicating one of the file descriptors
have gone bad. The check rebuilds the fd_set used by select().
Bugfix in HttpGetSocket, one of the constructors had no support in
HttpClientSocket - added.
Corrected bad #include's in Utility.
Added IStream interface to read/write from socket and IFile (memfile, normal
file). New classes SocketStream, FileStream, StreamWriter.
Added ReadInput method in TcpSocket - read from input buffer.
Added GetLine method in TcpSocket - chars input on current line when using
SetLineProtocol mode.

2.3.2
------
Threadsafe list of ssl initializer, ssl contexts and openssl error text 
retrieval.
Added interface for Mutex class, adding the possibility for others to
implement the mutex functionality using other approaches.
Moved FromUtf8 method from XmlNode to Utility.

2.3.1
------
Request: Remove() method in SocketHandler changed from private to protected.
Added Utility::Stack that returns a stack walk (currently linux only).
Request: Added $(DESTDIR) variable in Makefile for more flexible installation.
The timeout value is now reset before OnTimeout() is called, making it
possible to set a new timeout value in the OnTimeout() method.

2.3
------
Small change in ListenSocket<> to improve accepting of incoming
connections.
Added xml parsing classes: XmlDocument, XmlNode, and XmlException.
Added new OnDisconnect(flags, code) callback that provides reason
for the disconnect.
Fix crash bug if an event object gets deleted in its own OnEvent
method.
gcc 4.3 compability fixes.

2.2.9a
------
Added assignment operator on HttpRequest class.
HttpdForm sometimes got stuck in an infinite loop - fixed.
Lock using const Mutex, and Mutex modified to work when const.
Added Utility::Uri that can be used for parsing of an url.

2.2.9
-----
Fixed memory leak in TcpSocket.
Fixed potentially unsafe code in http form data parser (HttpdForm).
Fix memory and resource leak in HttpRequest.
Ajp13Socket/HttpBaseSocket now creates a copy of the HttpResponse
instance when sending a response, to avoid synchronization problems.
Added "lost" flag which is set when a tcpsocket has lost connection
unexpectedly (on read/write error). Earlier this function was only
present when the connection pool was enabled (ENABLE_POOL).
Removed unnecessary call to shutdown() when destroying a closed
tcp socket.
Added brief 'INSTALL' document.

2.2.8
-----
Added http client ability to receive a chunked response.
HTTP headers are now treated in a case insensitive manner.
MacOS leopard fixes.
Added callback "OnDataComplete" to HTTPSocket, which is called
when the full body of the request/response has been received.
New random generator (mersienne twister).

2.2.7
-----
Http header names no longer converted to lowercase.
"setsockopt()" wrapper methods returning int values has been fixed.
No longer sets query_string attribute of HttpRequest when there is no
query string present.

2.2.6
-----
Modified HttpRequest class to easier add support for pipelining.
Made the following classes work with the copy constructor: HttpRequest,
HttpTransaction, HttpdCookies.
Always adding http header names as lowercase in internal storage
(HTTPSocket). Added method to check if http header is set.
Changed IHttpServer interface to better separate request and response.
Added -mno-cygwin flag in Makefile defines for cygwin.

2.2.5
-----
A basic_string exception thrown while trying to access the first
(non-existing) element in a zero-sized string was fixed in HTTPSocket.
Added separate http_version for HttpResponse. Improved reset of state
information in HTTPSocket and derivates (for keep-alive connections).
MemFile support reads and writes larger than internal blocksize.

2.2.4
-----
IFile (File/MemFile) added reset_read and reset_write.
Bugfix MemFile read.
UdpSocket timestamp small fix for win32.
Cookies reworked in Http framework (Transaction/Request/Response
and HttpBaseSocket/Ajp13Socket).
Compile issue when compiling without openssl solved.

2.2.3
-----
SSL Handshake was never initiated when using both client and server from the
library - fixed.
UdpSocket read timestamp added (SetTimestamp) as new OnRawData method. Use
when timestamps enabled with call to SetSoTimestamp. Not win32.
MacOSX project added. Big Thanks to Bruce for both of these.

2.2.2
-----
Close file descriptor in File destructor.
HttpClientSocket new access method Filename.
Added a few access methods to HttpdSocket.
Check if gethostbyname_r failed.
Async resolver fix.
Fix win32 build problem (uint64_t).

2.2.1
-----
Adding (optional) exceptions when Bind() or CreateSocket() fails.
Enable with ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS.
Added GetSock* methods in Socket, to retreive information about local
port and address in a connection.
Added InitializeContext in TcpSocket with separate certificate / key files.
Moved some #include's from .h to .cpp files.
Removed multiple calls to recvfrom() in UdpSocket OnRead.
HTTPSocket corrected.

2.2
-----
TcpSocket output buffer error fixed.
HTTPSocket HTTP/1.0 request (or HTTP/1.1 with connection: close) fixed.
IEventHandler now won't crash if the IEventOwner is deleted in OnEvent.
Added Ajp13Socket that understands the ajp/1.3 protocol. Each request received
by the class results in an "OnExec(HttpRequest, HttpResponse)" call.
Added "HttpBaseSocket" that also use the "OnExec" method to process a
http/https request.

2.1.9
-----
Added exception class.
Changed platform selection in Unix Makefile.
Cleaner compile on mingw.
HTTPSocket supports keepalive.
OnDisconnect moved out of ENABLE_RECONNECT scope.

2.1.8
-----
Added missing (optional) namespace in SmtpdSocket.
TcpSocket: Calling OnDisconnect when reading 0 bytes.
TcpSocket: Added OnTransferLimit() callback, called when output buffer
size drops below limit set by SetTransferLimit().
Boundary bug (writes over two blocks failed) in MemFile fixed.
Member variables in SSLInitializer no longer static since SSLInitializer
in itself is static in TcpSocket (avoid potential problem with
initialization order of static's).

2.1.7
-----
Fatal bug in LineProtocol/Online found, when a crlf happens over a read
buffer boundary. FIXED.
New output buffer logic. OnWriteComplete callback added, which fires after
the output buffer has been transferred.

2.1.6
-----
No more random number generator in Socket. Random number generator used in
Utility changed to static.
ISocketHandler is now a pure virtual definition of the SocketHandler.
Added general purpose timeout to Socket class (SetTimeout, OnTimeout), and
used it to implement the connection timeout logic in TcpSocket/SctpSocket.
Also added OnConnectTimeout which is called instead of OnTimeout, if the
socket is in Connecting mode.
New StreamSocket class defines variables used for sock_stream stuff (such
as connecting, the line protocol).

2.1.5
-----
Changed socket and ip option calls to directly manipulate the socket. They
should be used in the OnOptions callback, to set up the connection before
it is used. OnOptions is only called on client sockets. It is not called on
incoming  connections accepted with accept()).
Removed Set methods from ResolvSocket and replaced them with one
constructor for each of the different resolves it can do.
Added DNS cache in ResolvSocket.
Made CircularBuffer an internal class of TcpSocket.
Moved these classes to a separate download:
 ICrypt NullCrypt CTcpSocket MinionSocket MinderSocket MinderHandler Uid
ListenSocket now sets SO_REUSEADDR in its OnOptions method.
Small fixes to SmtpSocket to support the new configuration stuff.
Added socket to socket trigger framework (sockets-config.h: ENABLE_TRIGGERS).
Small bugfix in TcpSocket::Open when trying to connect to an ipv6 host
with numeric ip address.

2.1.4
-----
Added traffic monitor function.
EventHandler/IEventOwner bugfix (pure virtual method called on takedown).
Added outstanding events counter to IEventOwner, to avoid calling
ClearEvents in destructor of an IEventOwner with no events to clear.
Modified GetTimeUntilNextEvent to not return a negative time.
Added SmtpdSocket serverside implementation.
Crash bug fix if trying to add a socket that already exists in
sockethandler queue.
Made a few classes internal (PoolSocket, EventSocket, SocketThread).

2.1.3
-----
Added optional Ipv6 and Detach functionality to sockets-config.h.
 (ENABLE_IPV6, ENABLE_DETACH)
Crash bug fix: if socket that asked a resolve question is destroyed
before answer arrives.
HTTPS (openssl) session support on server side.
Safer ssl read/write - tnx Peters!
All debug output now to stderr.
GetClientRemoteAddress and XXX now returns a copy of the address in
question, to avoid NULLing the source address when using std::auto_ptr.
SSL initialization code separated from TcpSocket and put in a new
SSLInitializer class.

2.1.2
-----
Fix for broken http framework.
Http and httpd tests added.
Configurable options moved to new 'sockets-config.h' file.
Restored code for dns resolve when getaddrinfo/getnameinfo isn't available.
(See sockets-config.h symbol NO_GETADDRINFO)

2.1.1
-----
Semaphore added.
Utility::GetTime() fixed on win32.

2.1
---
 * Added Utility::GetTime.
 * Created socket handler base class ISocketHandler. It will now be possible
   to write really customized sockethandlers. One effect of this is that
   the first parameter of the Socket class constructor changes from
   SocketHandler& to ISocketHandler& - this will affect all current
   software using the library.
 * StdLog constructor first parameter changed from SocketHandler*
   to ISocketHandler*
 * Modified list handling in Socket/SocketHandler.
 * Added possibility to clear tcp socket byte counters by passing
   'true' as input parameter to GetBytesReceived() and GetBytesSent().
 * Improved CircularBuffer performance when used as output buffer by
   TcpSocket.
 * Removed unused and confusing method ISocketHandler::GetSocket.
 * SocketAddress will replace direct use of ipv4/ipv6 addresses in the code.
 * Removed virtual supporting method Socket::ReadLine. If anyone was using
   that method, it used to be called directly after the OnRead callback,
   if SetLineProtocol was enabled. Repairing the functionality means
   adding a call of your own in the OnRead callback.
 * Optimized code for OnLine and HTTP header parsing.
 * Found and fixed a timing bug in thread code that could cause
   a segmentation fault.
 * 'echoserver.cpp' and 'stressclient.cpp' added, for test. Supports
   normal echo operation, http "echo" server and ssl server/client.

2.0.9
-----
Added a way to disable input buffering on tcp sockets.
The method TcpSocket::DisableInputBuffer() will prevent all writing
to the input buffer. After that, the only way to receive data is to
implement an OnRawData method. TcpSocket derived classes that
already only use OnRawData as a means of receiving data should
call DisableInputBuffer() to improve performance (and turn off those
annoying warning messages).
OnOptions will now be called by UdpSocket. OnOptions is now a pure
virtual method in the Socket class. Moved default implementation of
OnOptions from Socket to TcpSocket. Added empty implementations of
OnOptions in ListenSocket<>, UdpSocket and PoolSocket.
Made Sockets-config compile on mingw systems.

2.0.8
-----
gethostbyname_r only used if the symbol LINUX is defined.
Sctp protocol by default disabled. Enable by defining USE_SCTP.
Fixed warnings about GetSocket/handler in connect and disconnect
situations.

2.0.7
-----
Added Resolve(ipaddr_t) and Resolve(const std::string&) in Socket class
for reverse lookup. Added OnResolveFailed() callback to Socket when a
Resolve call failed.
Moved definition of SOCKETS_DYNAMIC_TEMP to socket_include.h to avoid
breaking windows application not using Sockets-config to retrieve
compile time flags.
Added "fd XX" to StdoutLog debug printout whenever a socket instance
generates an event, where XX is the file descriptor of the socket or
-1 if the file descriptor isn't valid.
Reset connected flag when read returns 0 - avoids using shutdown on
Close() and the following warning.
SCTP support added - see SctpSocket class.

2.0.6
-----
"gethostbyname()" calls are replaced with "gethostbyname_r()", to ensure
threadsafe operation.
If the flag SOCKETS_DYNAMIC_TEMP is defined at compile time of the library,
all application using the library must also define the same flag. In unix/
linux Makefiles this is easiest done by adding `Sockets-config` to the
CPPFLAGS variable.
Optimized SocketHandler by removing the SocketHandler::GetSocket method
and adding better code in each place where it was used - Thanks Samuel.
CircularBuffer now has a ReadString method.
Added method to remove a specific event to the EventHandler class.
Added methods to the IEventOwner interface to remove all events or
one specific events. - Thanks Thomas

2.0.5
-----
Added missing call to OnRawData when using ssl.
Bugfix in HttpPostSocket, where the boundary variable was never set.
Reset connecting flag in TcpSocket when a connection attempt fails.
Define SOCKETS_DYNAMIC_TEMP to use dynamically allocated temporary
buffers in read operations - helps on ECOS.
Compile with -O0 if you are using gcc 2.9.x.

2.0.4
-----
Improved Http client classes, now they're all able to receive a response.
Use methods SetFilename() / SetDataPtr() to write response to a file
or to memory respectively.
Small fix for uuid.h include for mac os x.
Removed debug printout in SSLInitializer.

2.0.3
-----
Url parsing modified for Http Get/Put/Post classes to enable ssl if the
url protocol is https.
TcpSocket/SSL random file modified, see tutorial page at
http://www.alhem.net/Sockets/tutorial/using6d.html
Removed a lot of old debug printouts.

2.0.2b
------
Replaced direct read access to sockets map with a method looping through
the map, to avoid adding null pointers to non-existing file descriptors.

2.0.2a
------
The new add control logic broke tcp reconnect, so this is a fix for that.

2.0.2
-----
Fixed infinite loop that could lock the main process when a socket attempts
to connect, gets data to send, and then the connection fails.
Added control so the same file descriptor can't be added to the socket
handler twice.
Utility::rfc1738_encode buffer overflow (read only) fixed.
Moved local hostname resolution stuff from SocketHandler to Utility
- see http://www.alhem.net/Sockets/tutorial/using6c.html
Project files for visual studio 6 slightly modified (missing dependency,
FD_SETSIZE define removed).

2.0.1
-----
Moved Errno declaration outside sockets namespace when compiling for unix.
This was already done for the win32 implementation.
Made typedef for socket_m in SocketHandler protected, since its use are
already protected.
Fixed problem with reconnect.

2.0
---
Optimizing SocketHandler.
Fixed SSL socket reconnect.
HttpGetSocket url parsing fixed. Really.
Increased char buffer size in HttpdSocket for large query_string's.
Added timer events, implemented in EventHandler.
Using _beginthreadex()/_endthreadex() to create/end thread in _win32.
Using GetTempPathA() explicitly when getting _win32 temporary path.
 * Removed (almost) all sprintf's.
Visual studio .net project now build multithreaded library.
Removed redundant classes SSLSocket, HttpsGetSocket, and HttpsSocket
(all SSL functionality now in TcpSocket).
Using dummy ssl types in TcpSocket if HAVE_OPENSSL is not defined.
Moved a few typedef's outside the optional sockets namespace in the file
socket_include.h.
Fixed Thread/SocketThread to avoid using method on deleted pointer.
Added CXX in Makefile.
Bugfix in SocketThread so the correct sockethandler will be used by the
detached socket object.
Added full mutex threadsafe operations. The old _THREADSAFE_SOCKETS
Makefile option is no longer in use.
Improved graceful shutdown of tcp connections when possible.
Moved address resolution methods from class Socket to Utility. The methods
are isip, u2ip, l2ip.
Added fix for unassigned names in httpdform parser.

1.9.9
-----
Trying to remove all dynamic_cast's. They are used in ListenSocket to
check that the Create method returns correct type, and in the socket
handler to give extra functionality to tcp sockets.
New callback OnDisconnect is called only when a connected tcp socket
is set for reconnect, and has lost connection.
Memory leak in TcpSocket output buffering fixed.
HttpGetSocket.url_this fixed.
Replaced HttpGetSocket.m_content string with an allocated byte buffer.
Fix bug in Utility::rfc1738_decode.
SocketHandler.Select can be called without parameters, which means it
will not return until an event has been received by a socket.
Automatic purging of tcp sockets that hang around too long with data
still left to send.
Added virtual destructor for ICrypt pure virtual.

1.9.8
-----
Nasty bug fixed on macosx that caused OnConnect to be called even if
the connection failed.
SSL client functionality restored. Cached data was not sent on connect
because the connected flag was not set.
Two new callbacks added for TcpSocket, to indicate that ssl negotiation
failed: OnSSLConnectFailed and OnSSLAcceptFailed.
HttpGetSocket: getting a https: address enables ssl....
Added fatal error if trying to use a ssl server without implementing
the initialization method (InitSSLServer).

1.9.7
-----
SocketHandler.OkToAccept now takes a socket class pointer as input
parameter, which can be used to identify which ListenSocket is
calling OkToAccept.
Treating socket exception as connection failed on win32
(if trying to connect).
Reset "flush before close" flag on write/read error.
Moved sockethandler Add logic once again, this time outside loop
checking for fd_set events..
Check if fd_set is getting full (trying to add more than FD_SETSIZE
sockets to the socket handler). Incoming connections are immediately
disconnected if the fd_set is full. TcpSocket::Open calls will
fail instantly if there is no more space in the fd_set.
Remember that FD_SETSIZE can be defined in socket_handler.h if there
is a need for larger fd_set's. The default on win32 is 64 slots which
is a bit thin. Linux and probably most unixes has 1024 slots...
On MacOsX the macro FD_COPY is used to copy the fd_set's before select().
More debug logging on exactly how a connection was established.

1.9.6
-----
Bugfix protecting the sockethandler from using deleted sockets.
(Socket class destructor calls SocketHandler.Remove in case the socket
is deleted before it is removed from the sockethandler).
Removed a lot of warnings for visual studio .net / 2005 beta.
Fix for bsd sockets sigpipe disable, using SO_NOSIGPIPE.
Solaris use putenv in HttpdSocket.
Added flag flush before close, telling a (tcp) socket to send all data
before closing even while the SetCloseAndDelete flag is set.
Default value: flush before close = true.

1.9.5
-----
Visual studio 6 and .net project files updated.
DevCpp project files updated.
Using openssl win32 installer from www.slproweb.com,
with installation location c:\OpenSSL.
Merged Sockets and SocketsEx projects in all windows projects.
Added winsock error texts.

ListenSocket.Bind slightly modified - if port 0 random assigned is
needed, 0 has to be specified in the Bind call (before this release
a Bind call with no parameters had the same effect).
Ipv6 support has been improved, with many of the ipv4/ipv6 methods
overall merged into one. Ipv6 support for reconnect and connection retry.
The connection pool now also support ipv6 connections.
Added SocketHandler.ResolverReady that indicates the resolverthread
is ready for queries.
UdpSocket constructor modified to also include an ipv6 boolean
parameter, because the socket file descriptor is created in the
constructor.
Change: UdpSocket.Bind returns 0 on success, -1 on failure, just like
ListenSocket<>.Bind.
Connection pool disabled by default. Use SocketHandler.EnablePool to
turn it back on.
HttpDebugSocket: Added first line of request (method url httpversion) to
page echoing the request.
TcpSocket ssl private key callback function no longer uses a static
member variable to store the password. This enables the use of any number
of private key files, each with a different password.

1.9.4
-----
Changed udp sockets to nonblocking.

1.9.3
-----
New define while compiling: _THREADSAFE_SOCKETS
This "thread safe" compile mode only protects OnWrite / SendBuf in
TcpSocket, but will probably include more sections of the code later on.
Mutex and Lock classes added.
HttpdCookies now excludes domain from the Set-Cookie http header
(if COOKIE_DOMAIN is defined as a blank string "").
Incoming connections should now respond quicker even when using a long
Select() timeout.
Documentation: All classes and Socket class members at least briefly described.
Tcp and Udp socket now shares a common virtual description of the Send
and SendBuf methods.
Fixed bug that caused too long connection timeouts.
UDP sockets reads up to 10 messages in one read event.

1.9.2
-----
Support for HttpdSocket http/1.1 keep-alive operation added.
Fiddling with the connection / reconnect code. Not perfect by a long shot.
If a connection timeout is set, and the socket is supposed to reconnect,
the socket will wait the defined connection timeout until a connection
retry is made even if the connection fails immediately.
OnConnectFailed() will only be called after all connection retries has
been attempted.
OnConnectRetry() will be called before each connection retry. Return
false from this callback method to abort connection retries and kill the
socket permanently.
Data sent before / between connection is preserved, whatever that's worth.
Added optional namespace for the entire library.

1.9.1
-----
Added SetConnected() in ListenSocket.h for TcpSocket's on accept.
If not, all incoming tcp connections refused to send their data.

1.9
---
Added reconnect and connection retry for TcpSocket's.
New callbacks:
OnConnectRetry() can return false to abort connection retries.
OnReconnect() when a connection has resumed.

1.8.7
-----
Added methods GetSsl() and GetSslContext() to access openssl structures
SSL resp. SSL_CTX in TcpSocket and SSLSocket.
HttpGetSocket no longer reports an error when initialized with an empty
filename.
SocketHandler::GetCount now returns actual number of active socket plus
number of sockets to be added to active sockets list.

1.8.6
-----
Socket::DisableRead - use this when creating a socket only for output
(the file descriptor will not be added to the read fd_set on select).
Added check to make sure no more than FD_SETSIZE sockets are added to
the socket handler.

1.8.5
-----
ReadLine fixed.

1.8.4
-----
Fixed a buffer problem that lost a byte for each read when doing large
http transfers (HTTPSocket, HttpsSocket, TcpSocket).
Added classes mentioned in v1.8.3...
Thread class implemented for win32 (not tested)

1.8.3
-----
(OnWriteComplete - pending)
(IFile - File - MemFile)
(HttpdSocket - HttpdForm - HttpdCookies)
Incoming sockets are no longer blocking
OnWrite no longer disconnect on EAGAIN error code
SSLSocket has been integrated with TcpSocket (still experimental)

1.8.2
-----
Removed warning about read after shutdown.
Socket does not try to do shutdown/close if the file descriptor is invalid.

1.8
---
ListenSocketBase functionality moved to ListenSocket template class.
The important addition is the Create() method in Socket - use that to
create a socket instance with an alternative constructor if needed.
TcpSocket::Open bugfix - sometimes returned false (connection failed)
although the connection was perfectly fine.
Socks4 client functionality added for outgoing connections. See new
SetSocks4Host, SetSocks4Port, SetSocks4Userid and SetSocks4TryDirect
methods in SocketHandler.
HttpGetSocket stores retrieved document in a private string member
variable, reducing the need for disk access.
Asynchronous DNS functionality added. Use the new SocketHandler method
EnableResolver() to enable this for resolving of all outgoing connections.

1.7.6
-----
Small changes in UdpSocket
New class ListenSocketBase as an alternative to ListenSocket<> template
class
New callback in Socket: Create - used by ListenSocketBase

1.7.5
-----
New callback on socket class: OnOptions, called when a new socket has
been created, to set options like SetReuse and SetKeepalive.
New get methods on MinionSocket.
Socket::Close now does a recv() after shutdown().
New logging level: Info

1.7.2
-----
HttpsGetSocket::url_this default port changed to 443 (was 80).
TcpSocket buffer sizes adjusted.
Switch off LineProtocol when reading the http body in HTTPSocket and
HttpsSocket.

	
1.7
---
HttpPostSocket added functionality, able to switch between url-encoded
form-data or multipart/form-data.
Connection pooling on TcpSocket's; When SetRetain() is called on a client
socket (that use Open / OnConnect), that sockets connection will be left
open and reused by the next TcpSocket the tries to open a new connection to
the same host / port.
This construction gives HTTPSocket HTTP/1.1 support for keep-alive
connections.
Pooled connections are stored as PoolSocket objects in the SocketHandler
socket list, and supervised like any other socket - if a pooled connection
is closed by the remote end, it's removed by the SocketHandler.


1.6.4
-----
Socket::SetParent / ::GetParent added, as a way to find out which
ListenSocket created the Socket. GetParent returns the pointer to the
ListenSocket object, or NULL if the Socket was created by the
programmer.
Win32: WSA startup code is wrapped in a class, which is created as a
static instance in Socket. This should automatically initialize
winsock when the first Socket is created.


1.6.3
-----
"errno" and "strerror" has been replaced by Errno and StrError,
and is defined for each operating system environment.
New classes for HTTP: HttpPutSocket, HttpPostSocket, HttpDebugSocket.

1.6.2
-----
Bugfix in ListenSocket, when opening a random port GetPort() returned
wrong port number - this is now fixed.
Defining methods depending on ipv4 or ipv6 was removed, and all ipv4 methods
renamed to their original names - without the '4'.


1.6.1
-----
Dummy copy constructor / assignment operator added to classes that can't be
copied by default.
Minor improvements to HTTPSocket.
Removed typedef string_v - collision with other projects that use same name
for std::vector<std::string> instead of internal use std::list<std::vector>


1.6
---
Improvements on win32 compile and linking. Remember to turn on rtti
information (/GR in visual studio), because I tend to use dynamic_cast a lot.

It is now possible to exclude openssl specific code, by not having
HAVE_OPENSSL defined at compile time.
Define HAVE_OPENSSL in Makefile or project file if openssl is installed
on your machine.

Bugfix in CircularBuffer. It finally works.

Renamed CircularBuffer method GetCount to "ByteCounter" - the method returns
the total number of bytes to have ever gone through the buffer.

Improved logging, and cleaned up old debug printouts.

Fixed a number of memory leaks that would occur in an application that
creates and recreates a lot of SocketHandler's, and also in the threading
part of the library.

Some optimizations for speed.


1.5.4
-----
UdpSocket: Broadcast flag, Multicast stuff


1.5.3
-----
SocketHandler no longer resolves local hostname on startup.
On hosts with unresolvable hostname this would cause a delay on startup.

Changed unix socket i/o from read/write to recv/send with MSG_NOSIGNAL
flag, to avoid sigpipe
 - see readsocket/writesocket macros in socket_include.h.


1.5
---

New callback: OnConnectFailed

new / modified methods to support ipv6:
	Socket::CreateSocket6
	Socket::u2ip
	Socket::l2ip
	Socket::GetRemoteIP6
	Socket::IsIpv6



04-04-12
--------
void TcpSocket::OnRawData(const char *,size_t)
called when new data is read

bool SocketHandler::OkToAccept()
called by ListenSocket - default implementation returns true
