# Plugin loading
#
# The syntax is as follows:
# > system.plugins += ("<name>":"[location]");
# Alternatively you can do this:
# > system.plugins.name = "[location]"
# If you use the second syntax, you're limited to [a-zA-Z0-9_]+ for the name.
# It's probably not a great idea to use any characters other than that anyway.
#
# <plugin name>
# The plugin name is whatever you like, it will be passed to the plugin so it
# can use it as a sort of instance name. For example if you have two different
# ban lists (for some reason), you could have them both operating at once by
# giving them unique identifiers.
#
# [location]
# The location is optional. If it's a zero-length string, mineserver tries to
# load it from within the main binary. Instructions on how to compile plugins
# into mineserver are pending, but it basically involves just compiling the
# plugin to an object file then linking it to the mineserver binary when it's
# built. If you omit the .dll/.so part of the filename, mineserver will try to
# add it automatically.
#
# More information on this topic will be covered on the wiki Soon (tm).
